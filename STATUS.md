Seems to compile with RxMobile, but I lack the time and patience
to figure out how to get the tests to actually run from the complicated build files.
It all builds just fine.

The sample application was using some really old version of RxAndroid,
and instead of trying to make that work, I removed it from the project
(until the sample in original repo gets updated).
